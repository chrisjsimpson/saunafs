/**
 * @brief Represents a single connection to a chunkserver.
 *
 * This struct manages the state and data associated with a connection to a
 * chunkserver. It includes information about the connection's state, mode,
 * sockets, and various buffers used for reading and writing data. It also
 * maintains metadata for managing the connection's lifecycle and handling
 * retries, timeouts, and partial writes.
 *
 * @details
 * The `ChunkserverEntry` struct is used extensively within the
 * `NetworkWorkerThread` to manage connections. It supports both reading and
 * writing operations, including forwarding data to other chunkservers in a
 * write chain. The struct also tracks job IDs and partially completed writes to
 * ensure data consistency and proper error handling.
